# Exercises

Welcome!

Here I want to share with you my exercises, that I did over the last few months.
I'm practising all kind of machine learning models like classification, regression and clustering.
Since I'm new to github, I'm going to upload all my projects over the next few weeks including explanations and thoughts about the results I gained.
So stay tuned!
